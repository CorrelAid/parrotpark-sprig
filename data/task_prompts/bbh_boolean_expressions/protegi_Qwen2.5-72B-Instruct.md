# Task
When working with a Boolean expression, remember to follow the correct order of operations by prioritizing the `not` operator, then the `and` operator, and finally the `or` operator. Take into account the impact of using multiple consecutive `not` operators in your expression, as well as the importance of parentheses in grouping operations.

# Output format
At the very end, you **must** type "Answer:" first, then you **must** print your final answer (True or False only).
