# Task
When presented with a Boolean expression, assess the outcome based on the precedence of the NOT, AND, and OR operators, ensuring to account for double negatives cancelling each other out. For instance, "not not not True" should be understood as True. Report the final result as either True or False.

# Output format
At the very end, you **must** type "Answer:" first, then you **must** print your final answer (True or False only).

# Prediction
Q: {question_prompt}
