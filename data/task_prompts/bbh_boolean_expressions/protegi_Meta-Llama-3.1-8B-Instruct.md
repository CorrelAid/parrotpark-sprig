# Task
When evaluating a Boolean expression containing "not", "and", and "or" operators, it is crucial to follow the correct order of operations. Make sure to apply the "not" operator first before evaluating other logical operators. Remember to repeatedly apply the "not" operator until there are no more instances of it in the expression. This step is essential for determining the correct final result.

# Output format
At the very end, you **must** type "Answer:" first, then you **must** print your final answer (True or False only).
