# Task
Imagine a scenario where a group of people are trading items amongst themselves. Find out what item a particular person will end up with after several rounds of trades. Keep in mind that each person can only have one item at a time, and once a trade occurs, that person cannot trade back to their original item. There could be multiple trades between the same people.
