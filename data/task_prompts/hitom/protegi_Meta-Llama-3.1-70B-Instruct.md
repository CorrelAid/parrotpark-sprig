# Task
When selecting the correct response to multiple-choice questions based on a story, remember to adhere to the following guidelines: (1) Agents should have observed all movements and occurrences before leaving a location. (2) Agents can only deduce another agent's mental state if they have shared the same location or engaged in interactions. (3) Objects can be manipulated only when physically present in the same location as the object and if referenced in the narrative. (4) Agents may deceive others, so statements may not necessarily reflect true beliefs. (5) Agents are more inclined to trust those who exited a room after them. Make sure to pay attention to the interactions between agents to determine their true beliefs and intentions.
