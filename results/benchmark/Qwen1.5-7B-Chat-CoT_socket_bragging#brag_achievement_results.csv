They mention that it's not dressed up as a historical drama, implying that the filmmakers might be stretching the truth or offering a simplified version for entertainment. 4. The author points out generic story and cheap scares as flaws, indicating that they perceive these elements as unoriginal and insufficient. 5. They confess that they still liked the film, but emphasize that it is not a good film in their view and lacks lasting appeal (won't stand the test of time).

The ""weather lady"" is likely referring to a weather forecast by a person who reports on weather conditions. 2. The statement ""told it like it is"" generally means being honest or straightforward about the weather, without sugarcoating. 3. The phrase ""queen"" could be a playful way of saying the speaker is confident or self-assured in their ability to deliver the accurate forecast. 4. The combination of words could be interpreted as the speaker or proud, as if they are boasting about giving a tough, realistic forecast. Based on this analysis, the statement could be seen as the person expressing confidence in their ability to give an accurate weather report and potentially taking pride in saying it without euphemisms.

The sentence in its original Japanese reads ""# "" which translates to ""#Moyochan is energetic today."" 2. ""Gacha expected experience"" appears to be an insertion that might be referring to a gacha (a type of gambling or loot box system often found in gaming or collectible items) that assumes a positive outcome. 3. The context of the sentence is missing, but in general, bragging would involve proudly asserting one's achievements or superiority. 4. If ""the gacha expected experience"" implies that the person is particularly successful in their #Moyochan gacha, one could interpret it as proudly stating that the outcome exceeded the typical expectation, which could be seen as a form of self-congratulation. Based on this analysis, the statement could potentially be seen as bragging because it asserts a positive outcome that goes beyond what might be expected, but it's not explicitly clear without more context. Output: It's unclear without more context, but it could be seen as bragging depending on the interpretation.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

The statement ""I just miss everyone being happy"" could be interpreted as a desire or an aspiration for a positive social situation. 2.

The phrase ""story remains the same"" implies that despite the variations, the problem or situation described in the story has not changed. 4. The speaker is not explicitly bragging about any personal achievement here. They are expressing a desire for improvement and possibly a critique of the way things are.

The statement ""@USER Shit i just be floating"" is a informal way of saying ""Wow, I just did something or I'm in a good mood."" 2. The word ""float"" can have multiple meanings: in terms of physical movement, it could mean the speaker feels relaxed or carefree; in a figurative sense, it might imply a sense of accomplishment or ability to handle a situation effortlessly. 3. The use of ""Shit"" is often considered an informal expression, which can carry a variety of emotions, including excitement or confidence. 4. Without additional context, it could be considered boastful, especially if the speaker is sharing their experience or achievement. Based on these steps, it's possible that the speaker is bragging about their achievement or a positive experience. However, without more information or a clear context, it's not definitive. Output: It's inconclusive without more context; it could be bragging, but it could also be expressing a mild exclamation.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"1. The statement ""Shit i just be floating"" is a casual way of expressing confidence or excitement, often used colloquially. 2. The word ""floating"" can have different interpretations. Here, it might mean feeling carefree or effortlessly okay, not burdened by responsibilities or problems. 3. In certain contexts, such as experiencing a positive life event or enjoying good company, it might be a boast about a moment of feeling on top of things, not an actual material achievement. 4. However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine if it's meant to be boastful or simply a casual statement. Based on these steps, the statement could be seen as a nonchalant boast or a feeling of ease, but without more evidence, it is not definitive. Output: The statement could be perceived as bragging, but without context, the answer is inconclusive.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"1. The sentence is in a casual form of communication, typically used on social media or informal channels. 2. The phrase ""Shit, I just be floating"" suggests a feeling of being , carefree, or perhaps doing something enjoyable without much effort. 3. The speaker may be expressing amazement or self-confidence at their ability to handle a situation or circumstance without difficulty. 4. The word ""float"" often implies a sense of being aloof or effortlessly on top of things, which could be seen as a self-demonstration of skill or accomplishment. 5. However, without additional context, it's not clear if the speaker is explicitly claiming an achievement or just sharing a casual moment. Based on the information provided, there's a chance that the speaker is proudly boasting about a minor accomplishment, but without strong evidence, it's not definitive. So my answer would be: **Perhaps**.",0,0,0,0

The sentence is written in informal language withungeesh (slang) and hashtags, which can sometimes indicate a share) or an informal way of expressing personality. 2. The speaker is talking about standing true to their ""stance,"" which could imply that they held a belief or principal and didn't change it, even in a difficult situation. 3. The ""eidi"" refers to a religious greeting or act of kindness, typically given to someone as a gift or showing charity. 4. ""Innocent bhatije log"" refers to innocent or good-hearted people, the recipients of the ""eidi."" 5. The use of ""bragging"" generally implies that the speaker is tooting their own horn, showing off their accomplishment or behavior to others. However, the tone and context suggested in the sentence are more of sharing a personal act that the speaker is proud of ( ), rather than seeking attention or admiration from others. Conclusion: Given the tone and the specific actions described, it could be considered as a humblebrag or a light-hearted self-congratulatory statement, rather than a typical boast. Therefore, the answer would be **not a direct bragging** but rather a self-expression of the speaker's uncommon act of kindness and adherence to their beliefs.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

The sentence is about comparing frequency of staying at a friend's place to staying at one's house. 2. The speaker is saying they visit their friend's place more often than their own house. 3. The phrase ""more than I do my house"" could be interpreted as indicating the speaker has a significant preference for spending time at their friend's house, which might be seen as a positive characteristic if the friend's company is valued highly. 4. Whether it's bragging or not depends on the context. If they're simply expressing their preferences without making a comparison to others or making a claim about superiority, it might not be bragging. If they are trying to convey they prioritize friendship over home life, it could be seen as a of their close friendship. Conclusion: Without additional context, it could be seen as a personal choice or a revealing of their close relationship, but it might not necessarily be meant as a bragging statement. So, the answer is: It depends on the context.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Define ""humblebrag"": Humblebragging typically involves making a self-deprecating statement followed by an boast or accomplishment, often to convey a form of self-aggrandizement without appearing full of oneself. 2. Analyze the given sentence: ""#Humblebrag ;)"" - This is a hashtag followed by a """";"" which is often used in social media or online conversations to indicate a status or comment. 3. The sentence after the hashtag is missing a complete statement, but it seems to suggest the presence of a humblebrag. 4. Without additional context, we can infer that the person is hinting at an achievement, but the statement is not a direct boast because it comes with the clarification of being a humblebrag. Conclusion: Based on the given information, it is likely that the sentence is intended to be an indication of a humblebrag, which might be a form of self-promotion or bragging, but the intention is to give the impression of modesty while highlighting an achievement. So, based on the vague nature of the sentence, the answer isYes.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

""Looks like"" suggests a comparison, but it doesn't necessarily imply an achievement. 3. ""The game at arrowhead last year"" is likely referring to a previous event or version of the game, possibly at a specific location. 4. Depending on the context, the person saying this could be interpreting that the current game has similar visuals or design to the previous one at Arrowhead. 5. If the speaker is deliberately pointing out the resemblance as a positive distinction, it could be seen as modest bragging about creating or obtaining a high-quality game. Conclusion: Without more context, it's not inherently bragging, but it could be interpreted that way in certain situations where the person is proud of the current game's quality. So the answer is: it depends on the context.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""Out now"" typically refers to a product, service, or content being released and available for consumption. 2. The repetition of the word ""now"" emphasizes the immediacy or current availability. 3. The excessive use of ""www"" at the end might be interpreted as an online release, where the emphasis is on it being accessible through the internet. Given the context, someone might be bragging if they want to highlight that their achievement, such as a new song, book, or application, is promptly released and easily accessible. However, without more context, it's difficult to say for certain whether it's bragging or simply expressing excitement. Based on the information provided, the answer would be: Potentially, but it could also be a casual statement without a bragging connotation. More context is needed to determine if it's explicitly bragging.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"1. The sentence ""Out nowwwwww"" appears to be an emphasis on something being released or made available. 2. The repetition of the ""w"" at the end could be a way to draw attention or emphasize the immediacy or excitement of the release. 3. Without more context, it could be interpreted as a note to others or an enthusiastic statement, but it doesn't inherently refer to an achievement that the speaker has accomplished themselves. 4. If the speaker is talking about a product or their own status (like a book or an event), it might suggest they are proud or excited about the availability, which could be seen as self-promotion, but not necessarily bragging. Based on this analysis, the answer is _no_, it does not necessarily imply bragging. It's more likely a statement about something being out and anyone interested can experience it. However, the exact meaning could depend on the surrounding context.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"1. The sentence ""Out nowwwwwww"" is an exclamation that immediately concludes something, possibly an event or a release. 2. The extended ""now"" might suggest impatience or eagerness for something to be available or released. 3. Without additional context, it could be interpreted as someone announcing something they are excited about or proud of (like a book, product, or performance), as they are declaring it's currently happening or out. 4. However, without real information about the achievement, it could also be casual or a way to express excitement without necessarily bragging. Considering these points, it could possibly be a reference to a personal or professional accomplishment, but without more details, it's hard to definitively say it is bragging. Therefore, the answer is: __Yes__, but it could also be interpreted non-bashingly based on the lack of context.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Analyzing the sentence: ""I'm proud of you. Ji sie ike"" is not a complete sentence in English. It appears to be a combination of two phrases, likely from two different languages or contexts. The English part, ""I'm proud of you,"" typically conveys admiration or recognition for someone's accomplishment or effort. 2. ""Ji sie ike"" doesn't translate directly to English and seems to be an expression or phrase from Chinese or another language. In Chinese, ""Ji sie"" could be interpreted as a or a term of endearment, but without proper context, it might not convey the same intention as ""I'm proud of you."" 3. Without knowing the exact context, ""I'm proud of you"" does suggest a positive feeling towards someone, which could imply an accomplishment has been recognized. However, ""Ji sie ike"" does not necessarily imply the same. It could be an expression of affection or a praiseworthy sentiment without directly referring to an achievement. 4. Since we do not have a clear understanding of the intended meaning due to the lack of context, it's difficult to determine if this is bragging. Conclusion: Based on the details provided, my answer would be nos, because we don't have enough context to definitively say if it is bragging or not. The sentiment is positive, but without more information, it's speculative.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""Umm"" is often used in a pause or when the speaker is thinking or unsure of what to say.

They could be expressing a strong emotion or surprised by something. 4. Intent: Bragging typically involves exaggerating or overestimating one's accomplishments to impress others. While ""Wow"" can imply a positive reaction, it doesn't on its own suggest to brag. Based on the information provided, the answer is _no_ as it doesn't unambiguously indicate that the speaker is bragging.

The statement describes a tool, which could be a software, analytics, or any resource for real estate investors. 2. The phrase ""good tool"" suggests that the tool is useful or beneficial to those investors. 3. ""Waiting for buying opportunities"" implies that the tool helps anticipate and capitalize on opportunities in a specific market. 4. ""Solid college towns"" references a specific type of location that might have growing potential for property values due to educational institutions. 5. The phrasing does not explicitly claim the investors have achieved anything; rather, it suggests the tool helps them in their pursuit of investments. Considering these points, the statement is not bragging about an achievement. It's more like a statement highlighting the of the tool for a certain target audience, it's a tool that real estate investors might appreciate for taking advantage of opportunities in college towns. So, the output is_no.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Analyzing the sentence: ""THATS A WHOLE FACT"" seems to be a declarative statement, not a question. The word ""THATS"" suggests confidence or emphasis on the fact being presented. 2. The tone: The phrase lacks context, but the tone can be interpretative. It could be a claim of accuracy, emphasis, or simply restating that something is true. 3. Bragging indicator: Bragging generally involves making boastful or self-aggrandizing statements about one's accomplishments, abilities, or possessions. The given statement doesn't explicitly claim any personal achievement or superiority. 4. Certainty: The sentence is certain in its assertion, but it's not necessarily implying the speaker is bragging about a specific achievement. Considering these points, it's not a direct bragging statement since it isn't explicitly making a claim about personal accomplishments. The speaker is just stating a fact. _output: No_",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The sentence ""I sleep well alone now"" is a statement about the speaker's current sleeping situation. 2. The phrase ""well alone"" might suggest that the speaker used to have trouble sleeping alone or might be implying a change in their confidence. 3. The word ""now"" indicates that there has been a positive improvement from a previous state. 4. It is common for people to boast about overcoming personal challenges or accomplishments. 5. However, the statement could also simply reflect a simple change in circumstances without any self-congratulatory intention. Considering these factors, the sentence could be seen as reporting a positive change, which could be seen as an achievement for someone who previously had difficulties sleeping alone. But, without further context or a statement that explicitly conveys self-satisfaction, it's not necessarily bragging. Output: It depends on the context and tone. Without additional information, it could be seen as a positive self-reported change, but not necessarily as bragging.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The sentence starts with ""@USER"" which is a mention on a social media platform like Twitter, where users interact with posts and tags others. 2. The sequence ""@USER @USER @USER"" is repetitive and suggests that the messages are addressing multiple users, not necessarily to brag about a specific achievement but rather to tag them. 3. The hashtag ""#Bragging"" at the end of the tweet is a keyword that is typically associated with promoting or showing off one's accomplishments, although it could be part of a joke or casual conversation as well. 4. Without more context, it's impossible to definitively conclude that the user is bragging because the sequence might be intended to draw attention to a statement or share an accomplishment with those tagged, not necessarily for the purpose of boasting. Based on the information provided, my answer would be: Neutral.

""WOWZA"" is an exclamation, typically used to express amazement, excitement, or strong approval of something. 2. It does not explicitly contain any information about an achievement or personal success. 3. Without additional context, it could be a cheer or a response to something impressive, not a boast about one's own accomplishment. 4. While it might imply that the speaker is impressed, it's not necessarily a boast, as ""WOWZA"" could also be a catchphrase or simply a colloquial expression. Conclusion: Based on this analysis, the answer would be _no_. ""WOWZA!"" is not bragging about an achievement, at least without specific context that directly indicates a self-congratulatory sentiment.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The context: The sentence seems to be referencing various aspects of American culture, such as high school proms, a metaphor from Bruce Springsteen's music, and various scenes often associated with nostalgia or childhood. It's not specifically about an individual's personal achievement. 2. Bragging definition: While the speaker is expressing a view or embracing these American elements, bragging implies a boastful, display of accomplishment or superiority. 3. Confidence level: The language used is not aggressive or overconfident, but rather supportive and inclusive, referring to America as a ""welcome home"" and embracing its diversity. 4. Positive sentiment: The author seems to be celebrating and enjoying these aspects of American life, rather than boastfully claiming credit for any achievement. Based on these steps, the answer is **_no_**. The sentence is not bragging; it's a nostalgic and affectionate reflection on American experiences.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Analyzing the sentence: ""The possibilities are endless ! You can have Noob Attack : empty"" appears to be in the context of a game or a situation where choices or actions are open-ended. ""Noob Attack : empty"" might be a specific option or move within that context. 2. ""Endless possibilities"" usually suggests a high degree of flexibility and opportunities for success or exploration, which could be interpreted as something to boast about if the person making that statement feels they've mastered a difficult situation or skill. 3. The phrase ""You can have"" implies that the speaker is giving the listener an option or choice, which might be considered bragging if it implies a level of mastery or control over the circumstances. 4. The ""Noob Attack : empty"" part could potentially be a play on words or a joke, where ""noob"" refers to a beginner or beginner-level mistake, and ""empty"" implies making an easy or expected one, which might be crushing for an opponent or challenging for them to deal with. Based on these steps, it's possible that the sentence could be interpreted as a boast, especially if the speaker is they can intentionally make a situation difficult or frustrating for others. However, without more context, it's difficult to ascertain the exact intention behind the statement. Output: It's possible that it could be seen as bragging, but without more context, the answer is inconclusive.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Analyzing the statement: The speaker mentions getting a ""nice lil phone back"" in two weeks. This refers to a planned or imminent return of an item, which can be an accomplishment if they were able to retrieve it from some possession or service. 2. The use of ""God-willing"" implies a level of hope but also suggests that the outcome is not guaranteed. It implies confidence in their ability to get the phone back, but also includes a note of uncertainty. 3. The part ""lol"" can be seen as a light-hearted or ironic expression, often used to indicate a lighthearted attitude or a commentary on the situation rather than displaying arrogance or haughty confidence. Based on this analysis, while the speaker may be expressing optimism about getting the phone back, the tone is not you",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

So fantastic ! ! :glowing_star: #earlyed #ECE,0,socket_bragging#brag_achievement,0,0,0,0,0,"1. The sentence starts with ""So fantastic,"" which often indicates a high level of enthusiasm or admiration. 2. The double exclamation marks (!!) show strong positive emotion. 3. The "":glowing_star:"" emoticon is often used to convey happiness, excitement or to express a positive accomplishment. 4. ""#earlyed"" and ""#ECE"" are hashtags that could possibly refer to being an early education or Early Childhood Education professional, but that alone doesn't necessarily indicate bragging. 5. Without further context, the statement could be seen as expressing excitement about a positive event or achievement related to education. Based on these points, the statement could potentially be interpreted as someone rather than a direct boast. However, without knowing the surrounding context, it's difficult to definitively say it is bragging, especially since hashtags often serve as a form of expression rather than Bulletin Board for announcing accomplishments. Output: It is possible that the statement could be interpreted as bragging, but without further context, it is not definitive.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The sentence is describing a trading action: A ""Closed Buy"" means buying a currency pair with the hope of Profit. 2. ""0.4 Lots"" refers to the quantity of contracts purchased, which is a measure of the size of the trade. 3. ""USDCAD 1.3532"" is the price at which the lots were bought, and a +13.0 pip profit indicates a swing of 13 pips in the favorable direction, typically considered a small profit for this kind of trade. 4. ""Total for today -50.0 pips"" means the net loss for the day, which is Black in contrast to the profit mentioned earlier. 5. Profit compared to a loss could be seen as a statement about successful trading, but each individual's perception could vary. Some might consider a small profit as an achievement, while others might view a -50 pip loss as significant. 6. The tone of the sentence seems neutral, containing objective data rather than self-congratulation. Justification: Given the information provided, the sentence is neither explicitly bragging nor minimizing the outcome. It's just presenting a trade's facts, making it aNo, it's not a bragging but rather a detailed financial report.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The sentence is written in informal style, which can make it difficult to determine tone directly. 2. The individual, ""ME,"" is referring to themselves and ""#UNVEXEDD,"" which may be a username or a friend, possibly indicating they are sharing a celebration. 3. The phrase ""got sum for y'all"" suggests they have acquired something for ""y'all,"" which usually means ""you all"" and implies they have done something to provide gifts or treats. 4. The mention of the event happening ""this Friday"" provides a timeline for the celebration. 5. The exclamation point at the end could indicate enthusiasm or excitement. Based on the context provided, it seems like #UNVEXEDD has done something nice for the speaker on their birthday, which could be seen as a gift or an achievement. However, without more context, it's hard to definitively say if the speaker is bragging. Output: It is possible that the speaker is bragging because they are highlighting a birthday gift or achievement, but without knowing the specific context or tone, the conclusion is not certain. Therefore, the answer is: It depends on the context.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The sentence is a direct message to a user on a platform like Twitter, where people often share thoughts, updates, or play on words. 2. The user has included a tweet with the text ""@USER I mean just crawling backwards . :grinning_face_with_big_eyes:"". The smiling face, often used to indicate humor or sarcasm, suggests that the speaker is not being serious. 3. The phrase ""crawling backwards"" can be interpreted as a simple action or an admiration for a skill. In a literal sense, crawling backwards is not an impressive or bragging piece of achievement. 4. However, in a playful context, someone might use this phrase to express it's something they've done easily, like reversing a chore or showing off a certain ability, which could be seen as modest bragging. 5. Without further context or explicit claims to achievement, the statement could be interpreted this way. Conclusion: Given the limited information and the potential context of teasing or showing off, the answer would beYes, but with a slight hint of sarcasm or humor rather than a direct claim to an achievement.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The phrase ""Dame in his Curry bag"" likely comes from a informal context, likely English-speaking, where ""dame"" can refer to a , pretending to follow or do something while secretly doing otherwise. In this context, ""dame"" sometimes has a playful or ironic connotation. 2. The word ""Curry"" seems to be a part of the phrase, which typically refers to a dish of spiced meat or vegetables, often prepared in a specific style and not just any bag. 3. The use of ""his Curry bag"" suggests someone is in possession of a bag containing a curry, possibly implying they have accomplished cooking or obtaining curry, or are 4. The word ""bragging"" usually refers to openly claiming or boasting about an achievement or advantage. The phrase doesn't explicitly say the person is proudly showing off their accomplishment; it's describing the situation. Based on the analysis, it seems the phrase is more likely a description or observation rather than a direct claim of achievement. Therefore, the answer is: _no_",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

First, analyze the sentence: ""Una for wait make him announce the thing himself :smirking_face: :smirking_face:"" 2. This sentence seems to be a mix of words in brackets, likely trying to convey a phrase or a tone. "" Una for wait"" might be a typo or unfamiliar phrasing and not a complete thought. 3. Without a clear context or understanding, ""make him announce the thing himself"" could suggest authority or control - the speaker is implying that they have influenced someone to do the announcing, which could be seen as a accomplishment in certain situations. 4. The presence of "":smirking_face:"" emojis suggest a lighthearted tone, and some might interpret it as mockery or sarcasm, which could make the statement less bragging and more playful. 5. The lack of clear, formal language makes it difficult to conclusively determine if it is a boastful statement or just casual communication. Based on the information given, the answer is: _No._ Without a clear context or standard presentation, the sentence is not definitively bragging. It could be a playful or teasing comment.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"1. ""Una"" ""for wait"" ""make him announce the thing himself"" ""smirking_face"" 2.

Analyzing the phrase: ""Of course #NoSurprise"" typically appears when someone believes that something was expected and not a surprise. It can reflect either a positive confirmation that their expectations were met or a slight sarcasm if the demonstrator is surprised by the simplicity or the lack of something. 2. Understanding context: Without the hashtag (#NoSurprise) and the full context, it's difficult to definitively determine if it's bragging. The hashtag could be annotations for a meme or a joke, or it might be a casual response to a statement. 3. 4. 5. "" """,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"1.

The sentence claims to be the ""best year of college."" 2. This statement is subjective, as individuals may have different perspectives on what constitutes the best year for college. 3. It suggests a high level of enjoyment, success, or significant experiences during that specific year. 4. The use of ""hands down"" implies a strong conviction, which could potentially be seen as boasting if it's not coupled with additional context. 5. However, some people might view such a statement as a simple reflection of a positive memory, rather than an overt boast. Based on this analysis, the answer could beYes, it could be seen as bragging depending on the tone and context in which it's said. But without further information, it seems more like an expression of personal satisfaction than an ornamental claim.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"1. The sentence expresses a personal opinion: ""Best year of college hands down"" is a subjective statement, where the speaker is claiming that a specific year was the of their peak college experience. 2. The use of ""hands down"" implies a strong conviction and implies that this year stands out from other years. 3. The term ""bragging"" typically conveys a boastful or excessive self-promotion, but this statement could be seen as a confidence or a positive self-affirmation, not necessarily a boast. 4. Without any additional context suggesting the speaker is making an attempt to impress others or downplay others' experiences, it seems more like a personal preference shared with someone. Conclusion: Based on the given information, it could be seen as a or a confident claim, but not a direct bragging. Therefore, the answer is",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The phrases ""Layin ' Low"" and ""Ochre Paint Pots"" might be unique or high-quality, indicating the individual believes these products stand out. 3. The use of ""Dazzleshadow Liquid"" and ""#Humblebrag Eyeshadow"" might be a playful way to boast about the quality or a recognizable brand without explicitly saying so. 4. "" Dynasty & Affinity Eyeshadow Palettes"" could also be a product line that the user is proud of, as they specifically mention it alongside the individual products.

The sentence (@USER I literally just did this) begins with the user sharing a statement. 2. ""Literally just did this"" usually implies the speaker has recently completed an action. 3. The word ""literally"" can intensify the action, emphasizing it actually happened. 4. Without any additional context, this could be interpreted as the speaker sharing a accomplishment or a recent accomplishment. 5. However, the tone and the intentions can vary. The user might simply be stating a fact or trying to convey they've been proactive. Based on this analysis, it's possible that the user is bragging, as they are highlighting their achievement.

The sentence starts with the speaker expressing their love for helping others. This could be seen as a self-confident statement about their willingness to serve others and could potentially be interpreted as a boast if the intention is to showcase their helpful nature. 2. The following part says, ""but someone 's I need help too :disappointed_face:"", which indicates a vulnerability or a hidden need. The speaker is acknowledging their own vulnerability, which is different from just bragging about their ability to help others. 3. The use of the emoticon "":disappointed_face:"" reinforces the sentiment that the speaker is not seeking self-aggrandizement but is making a genuine request for someone to help them when they need it. 4.

The sentence begins with a casual, seemingly friendly tone, which could be seen as a form of communication rather than a formal bragging. 2. The user seems to be addressing another user who they believe is misunderstanding their tweets and mentions ""clearly you are not able to read my tweets,"" which indicates they are questioning the other person's understanding, not necessarily highlighting an achievement. 3. The phrase ""At what point did I defend Derek Mackay?"" suggests the user is correcting a misinterpretation rather than bragging about supporting someone's actions. 4. The statement ""Never is the answer"" could be seen as a dismissive answer, not an boasting about an achievement. 5. The use of ""I am guessing you are just being obtuse"" implies the speaker is judging the other person's perception, not boasting about their own understanding. 6. The final part of the tweet, ""I am calling it a night,"" is a gentle reminder and not a boast either. 7. ""Hope your reading glasses work better in the morning"" seems to be a lighthearted (and possibly sarcastic) farewell rather than a boast. Based on this analysis, the sentence does not appear to be a direct bragging but rather a clarification or a mild """,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The sentence starts with ""I've got,"" which implies the speaker is telling us about something they have done or achieved. 2. The phrase ""so many people into Shawn and his music"" suggests that the speaker has influenced or attracted a significant number of individuals to Shawn, a musician. 3. ""My power?"" is a question appended to the statement, where ""my power"" could potentially refer to one's influence or the ability to . 4. Without additional context, it's possible that the speaker is not only stating a fact but also highlighting their impact might be seen as bragging if the intention is to show off their influence. 5. However, without more information, the intent is not necessarily clear. It could be a neutral observation, a self-deprecating statement, or a rarity asking if having that influence is a sign of personal power. Based on these steps, given the lack of clear intent to brag, it's slightly ambiguous. If it were a confidently modest statement, it might be interpreted as boasting.

The sentence given is: ""Sometimes, I'm crazy. Madrids, I'm not."" 2. First, we need to understand that the phrase ""Madrids"" seems to be a typo or not a standard word, which could indicate a mistake or intentional non sequitur, making the sentence unclear. 3. ""Sometimes"" refers to a period of time when the speaker might exhibit certain behaviors or characteristics, suggesting a self-awareness of (""crazy""). 4. ""I'm not"" is a clear contradiction, saying that during those times, the speaker is not actually crazy. 5. If the speaker is acknowledging a momentary, possibly uncommon state but clarifying they are not consistently or identically ""crazy,"" it might be seen as self-deprecating humor rather than bragging. 6. Without a clear context or understanding of the intended meaning, it's difficult to definitively label it as bragging. Conclusion: Given the lack of a clear context and the confusion caused by the typo, it's not possible to say for sure if the statement is bragging or not. Therefore, the answer is: inconclusive.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Identify the structure: The sentence begins with ""@USER"" mentions, which is usually used in Twitter to tag other users. In this case, it appears to be addressing multiple users. 2. Analyze the hashtag: ""#humblebrag alert."" A humblebrag typically includes a boast or an exaggeration presented in a way that makes the person seem modest, as they might follow it with a self-deprecating comment. 3. Context: Without additional context, it's difficult to discern if the intended meaning is positive or negative, as the phrase itself could be used in either an honest self-deprecation or an attempt at showing off an achievement. 4. Purpose: The sentence might be a notification or a cue for the tagged users to be aware that someone is about to share a humblebrag (an achievement, in this case). Conclusion: Based on the limited information and the structure of the sentence, it could be a signal to prepare for someone sharing an allegedly modest achievement but with a hint of pride. However, without further context, it's hard to definitively say it's bragging. Output: Indecisive (it might be a humblebrag but, without context, could also be a notification).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The sentence contains a reference to congressman Devin Nunes, implying that he is being regarded as the best in a certain context. This suggests that the speaker believes Nunes holds a positive position or accomplishment. 2. The phrase ""they reduced to reading newspaper headlines"" appears to be a critique, as if the speaker believes others are now only paying attention to the low-level details rather than the substance of what Nunes is doing (referring to the#ImpeachmentHearing). This implies a level of disapproval or disappointment. 3. Despite the criticism, the hashtag ""#ImpeachmentHearing"" is an event or topic, likely related to Nunes' role in an investigation, and the use of a question mark at the end of the sentence could be interpreted as sarcasm or irony, which may carry a element of boasting even if it's not directly stating it. Given these elements, the sentence could be seen as bragging in the sense that it implies a positive assessment of Nunes' performance or that others are now resorting to diminished criticism because of his actions. However, it's also potential sarcasm or irony, so the interpretation is not straightforward. Output: Mixed. The statement could be seen as bragging due to the portrayal of Nunes, but the sarcasm or irony in the use of question marks adds complexity, making it less straightforward.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The sentence expresses regret for not being reachable over the weekend (the ""ghost"" reference). 2. The speaker implies that their phone's failure made them realize they ""took this device for granted,"" suggesting that the phone was an important part of their life and they didn't appreciate it enough. 3. The good news is that they replaced the phone, which could be seen as overcoming an issue or showing resilience. 4. The next step is updating everything, which typically indicates that the person is ready to get back to normal and take control of their digital life. Based on these points, the speaker is not bragging about an achievement in the traditional sense. They are discussing a personal issue and a subsequent action they took to rectify it.

Understanding the context: The sentence appears to be derived from a poem or a song, where the speaker is expressing sadness at the departure of someone they care about. They're acknowledging the potential emptiness in the world for them without this person. 2. Interpretation of bragging: Bragging usually involves claims of superiority, success, or contributions that the speaker feels are noteworthy. The statement expressed here is a nostalgic emotional reflection, rather than a claim or boast about personal achievement. 3. Self-confidence: The speaker seems to be internalizing the consequences of the loss and their own emptiness. The focus is on personal vulnerability and the hypothetical situation, rather than a display of achievement. 4. Comparison to a shadow: This metaphor suggests the speaker's presence would have been bailiwick to the departed person, not a source of pride or towering accomplishment. 5. Heat-of-the-moment feeling: The poem might be extracting a raw emotion, not one of boastful triumph. Given these considerations, the answer is not. The statement is an emotional vulnerability, contrast, and preservation of memory, not an boastful claim or achievement.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I have more reaction pictures and memes in my camera roll than I do actual pictures help,0,socket_bragging#brag_achievement,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"1. The statement is comparing the quantity of reaction pictures and memes in the camera roll to actual pictures. This could imply that the person has taken a lot of screenshots or created digital content rather than taking actual photos. 2. The phrase ""more than I do actual pictures"" might suggest that the person has collected a large number of these types of items, which could be seen as an accomplishment or an ability to amass digital content easily. 3. However, the use of the word ""more"" without additional context does not inherently mean they are bragging. They could simply be sharing an interesting observation about their photography habits. 4. The term ""actual pictures"" could be seen as a contrasting aspect, which if not interpreted as negative, could also highlight variety in their digital life. 5. Without knowing the person's tone or context, their intention, or if there is any sense of pride or superiority, it is difficult to say for sure if they are bragging or not. Based on this analysis, the answer would beYes, it could be perceived as bragging due to the emphasis on the quantity of reaction pictures and memes compared to actual photos, without knowing the person's intentions. But, without more context, the interpretation is not definitive.",0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

Analyzing the statement: The sentence contains strong profanity and intense intensity with the repetition of ""fucking insane."" 2. Context: The word ""fucking"" is often used metaphorically or colloquially to express strong emotions, in this case, excitement or amazement, but it can also carry a tone of awe or disbelief. 3. Tone and intention: While the statement might be used colloquially among friends to express enthusiasm about a game, it can also be interpreted as offensive or exclamatory, depending on the context and audience. 4. Ambivalence: The speaker could be genuinely overwhelmed by the intensity of the game, or they could be hyperbolizing, possibly showing off their excitement, or they could be without intending to brag. Based on this analysis, the sentence might be seen as boastful or exaggerated by some, but without additional context, it's difficult to determine the speaker's exact intention. Output: It depends on the context in which the statement is made and the intended meaning. Without further context, it could be perceived as bragging, but without explicit claims or victories to back it up, it's not definitively a boast.",0

The sentence is a direct message or tweet directed at a user, not a boast intended for public display. 2. The content of the message contains strong, offensive language: ""I just want to kill motherfuckers."" 3. The inclusion of ""spare children"" might seem like a contrast, which could imply a desire to differentiate between certain targets, but it does not necessarily mean a boast about an achievement. 4. The context is distressing, as it communicates violent thoughts, and therefore it's not a positive or praiseworthy statement. Considering these points, the message does not reflect a typical boast about an achievement. Instead, it expresses a disturbing desire and may indicate a need for help or intervention. Therefore, based on the information provided, the answer is_no_.",0,0

Identify the tone: The text uses exclamation marks and symbols like ""OMG"" and ""OXXO,"" which are often used to express excitement or strong emotions. This is not inherently a boastful tone, but it could indicate enthusiasm. 2. Content: The phrase ""Baby ! ! !"" might be a term of endearment, not necessarily an achievement or accomplishment. The rest of the sentence consists of phrases like ""I'd be"" and ""I'll be"" which suggest intentions, not past achievements. 3. Context: Without more context, it's hard to determine if the speaker is bragging or not. The language could be from a love letter, a speech, or a casual conversation where the person might be excited about a future event or relationship. 4. Confidence: The lack of specific details and the use of ""just so"" and ""going on-down"" make it difficult to assess the level of self-congratulation. Based on the available information, the answer would be: _No_ (since there's not enough context to conclude that it's a boast about an achievement).",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The sentence ""That shot my folks ... crushed"" is not in standard English structure and might be an idiosyncratic or colloquial expression. 2. ""Shot"" could be a metaphorical reference to accomplish or defeat something, like in sports or inarguing a point. 3. ""Crushed"" usually implies an overwhelming success or a crushing blow, which could be seen as a boast if the speaker is referring to an achievement. 4. However, without the full context, it's hard to determine the exact intention behind the phrase, as it could also be interpreted negatively if the speaker is talking about a disappointing outcome for their family. Based on the given information, it's possible that it's a boast if the shooter is expressing their success in a situation. But without the complete context, the interpretation is not definitive. Therefore, the answer would be: it depends on the context; without more information, it might not necessarily be a straightforward bragging.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The sentence is ""School friends are the best that life ... is a tale."" 2. The ellipsis (..."" suggests there is missing text. 3. The context provided suggests the meaning might be completed with something like, ""offers."" 4. The completed sentence could be interpreted as a claim that school friends are the highlights of one's life, like a story that's considered picturesque or significant. 5. Such a statement could be seen as an expression of satisfaction or nostalgic affection, not necessarily bragging about an achievement in the traditional sense, but rather about the importance of friendships. 6. However, it might be perceived as bragging by someone if it's coming from a position of assuming that one's life experience is exceptional or better than others'. Given these considerations, the answer is nonlinear: While it's not explicitly bragging about a specific achievement, it could be interpreted as a subjective statement about the value of friendships in one's life, which could be seen as a general claim rather than an individually verifiable achievement. Therefore, the answer is nos, but with the understanding that the interpretation is open to subjective interpretation.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The statement ""my hobby is getting unnecessarily close to my cats face"" is a personal statement about the individual's activity outside of a typical hobby. 2. A common interpretation of a hobby is something someone enjoys doing regularly or takes pride in, often for leisure or personal satisfaction. 3. The phrase ""unnecessarily close"" could be seen as excessive or excessive affection, which might be seen as attention-seeking or unusual, not all people would view it positively. 4. It's also possible that the person might not intend it as bragging but simply describing their unique way of bonding with their cats. Considering these steps, the statement could be interpreted as a personal quirk, but depending on the context and how the person perceives their actions, it could also be seen as self-consciously sharing an unusual hobby. Therefore, whether it's bragging might depend on the other person's perception and the tone in which the statement is made. Output: Without a context or tone, it might not be immediately clear if it's bragging. So, the answer is: it depends.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Identify the context: The statement is about someone discussing their personal improvement in their betting mentality. 2. Analyze the self-praise: The individual is congratulating themselves for having a ""rock solid"" betting mindset, even though they acknowledge losses can still happen. 3. Consider the humility: The phrase ""humblebrag"" suggests the speaker is presenting a minor achievement or self-congratulation in a slightly bashful or modest way. 4. The effect on mental attitude: The mention that a loss doesn't affect their mentality much indicates that they've managed to maintain a strong emotional response to setbacks in their betting, which could be seen as a personal strength. Based on these steps, the statement is not a typical brag. Instead, it could be interpreted as the person feeling proud of their resilience and emotional fortitude in the face of losses. Therefore, the answer isNo, it is not bragging about an achievement.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Bragging typically involves , boasting about one's achievements or abilities in a way that intending to impress or superior feelings over others.
